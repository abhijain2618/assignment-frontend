⭐ `*Requirements*`:

● The dashboard should list all launches of SpaceX.

● The User should be able to view the details of the launch on a modal.

● The User should be able to filter and see upcoming and past launches.

● The User should be able to filter based on if the launch was successful.

● The application should have an empty state and loading state indicator.

● After applying the filter, change the URL so that if the user copies the URL and sends it to a friend then the friend should see the data with the filter applied. In other words when the page is refreshed then the filter should NOT be removed. This is mandatory.
